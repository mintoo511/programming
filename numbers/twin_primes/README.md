## TWIN PRIMES
### Introduction

Twin primes are pairs of primes which differ by two. The first twin primes are {3,5}, {5,7}, {11,13} and {17,19}. It has been conjectured (but never proven) that there are infinitely many twin primes.

#### Output 
* Enter first number: 2
* Enter second number: 60

Result
* Twin primes: (3,5)  (5,7)  (11,13)  (17,19)  (29,31)  (41,43)
